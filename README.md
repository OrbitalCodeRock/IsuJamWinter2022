A game in-progress where you control a small village. The current objective of the game is to gather resources and defeat invading enemies.

Originally, this project started off as a game jam game but the scope of the project was too large for 7-days time.
That being said, I plan on getting this game to the point where it is playable (and hopefully fun) and positing it on itch.io.
Right now, there is no official design document, but I may actually make one (or at least something similar) since there are a lot
of different things going on when it comes to making this type of game.

Some mechanics I currently envision being added into the game:
  - Commanding single units or groups of units
  - Mining resources from objects like trees or rocks
  - Hunting/fighting wild animals such as deer or wolves.
  - Interacting with intelligent creatures (like vampires for example) who could potentially have their own bases.
  - Leveling up units
  - Customizing units (For example: changing equipped items)
  - Creating more buildings for your village
  - Upgrading village buildings
  - Farming
  - Crafting/finding items or tools
